The relationship between resistance and current is, as resistance increases, current decreases. In the first circut the side with the higher resistance has less current at the end of the circut than the side with less resistance.
Using resistors in a series or in a parallel has some advangates. like less restistance flowing over the same line and instead splitting the current up into 2 parts.
